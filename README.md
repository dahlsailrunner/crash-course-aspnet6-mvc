# MVC Crash Course - ASP.NET Core 6

## Prerequisites

* Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* Have an IDE installed - the three main options are:
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - include the [C# language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
  * [Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Community Edition is fine
  * [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### VS Code Setup

Any flavor of Visual Studio or Rider will include
the things you need to run ASP.NET projects, but
VS Code requires some additional setup.

The `C#` extension (link above) is required to use this repo.  I have some other settings that you may be curious about
and they are described in my [VS Code gist](https://gist.github.com/dahlsailrunner/1765b807940e29951ea6bdfb36cd85dd).
